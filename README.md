# calcentral-qa-test-auto

A QA Test Automation framework for [Calcentral](https://github.com/ets-berkeley-edu/calcentral).


### Instructions for running
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
2. Run `run.sh` (may required sudo. If so, run as `sudo -E ./run.sh` to pass in environment variables). 
The first run will take longer since the docker container will be downloaded and then run.
