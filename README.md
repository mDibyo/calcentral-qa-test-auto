# calcentral-qa-test-auto

A QA Test Automation framework for [Calcentral](https://github.com/ets-berkeley-edu/calcentral).


### Instructions for running
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
2. If using external test directory, set `$CC_TEST_DIR` to location of external test directory.
3. Run `run.sh` (may required sudo. If using external test directory, run as `sudo -E ./run.sh` to 
pass in environment variables). The first run will take longer since the docker container will be 
downloaded and then run.
